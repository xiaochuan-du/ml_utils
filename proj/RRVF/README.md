# Recruit Restaurant Visitor Forecasting
[Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/recruit-restaurant-visitor-forecasting/kernels?sortBy=hotness&group=everyone&pageSize=20&competitionId=7277)

## Description
Running a thriving local restaurant isn't always as charming as first impressions appear. There are often all sorts of unexpected troubles popping up that could hurt business.

One common predicament is that restaurants need to know how many customers to expect each day to effectively purchase ingredients and schedule staff members. This forecast isn't easy to make because many unpredictable factors affect restaurant attendance, like weather and local competition. It's even harder for newer restaurants with little historical data.

Recruit Holdings 
- Hot Pepper Gourmet (a restaurant review service)[site](http://www.hotpepper-gourmet.com/)
- AirREGI (a restaurant point of sales service) [site](https://air-regi.com/)
- Restaurant Board (reservation log management software).

In this competition, you're challenged to use reservation and visitation data to predict the total number of visitors to a restaurant for future dates. This information will help restaurants be much more efficient and allow them to focus on creating an enjoyable dining experience for their customers.

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated on the root mean squared logarithmic error.

The RMSLE is calculated as
[]..

where:

nn is the total number of observations 
pipi is your prediction of visitors
aiai is the actual number of visitors 
log(x)log‚Å°(x) is the natural logarithm of xx
Submission File
For every store and date combination in the test set, submission files should contain two columns: id and visitors.  The id is formed by concatenating the air_store_id and visit_date with an underscore. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

id,visitors
air_00a91d42b08b08d9_2017-04-23,0  
air_00a91d42b08b08d9_2017-04-24,0  
air_00a91d42b08b08d9_2017-04-25,0  
etc.

## Data Description

In this competition, you are provided a time-series forecasting problem centered around restaurant visitors. The data comes from two separate sites:

- Hot Pepper Gourmet (hpg): similar to Yelp, here users can search restaurants and also make a reservation online
- AirREGI / Restaurant Board (air): similar to Square, a reservation control and cash register system

You must use the reservations, visits, and other information from these sites to forecast future restaurant visitor totals on a given date. 
The training data covers the dates from 2016 until April 2017. 
The test set covers the last week of April and May of 2017. 

The test set is split based on time (the public fold coming first, the private fold following the public) and covers a chosen subset of the air restaurants. Note that the test set intentionally spans a holiday week in Japan called the "Golden Week."

There are days in the test set where the restaurant were closed and had no visitors. These are ignored in scoring. The training set omits days where the restaurants were closed.

File Descriptions
This is a relational dataset from two systems. Each file is prefaced with the source (either air_ or hpg_) to indicate its origin. Each restaurant has a unique air_store_id and hpg_store_id. Note that not all restaurants are covered by both systems, and that you have been provided data beyond the restaurants for which you must forecast. Latitudes and Longitudes are not exact to discourage de-identification of restaurants.

air_reserve.csv
This file contains reservations made in the air system. Note that the reserve_datetime indicates the time when the reservation was created, whereas the visit_datetime is the time in the future where the visit will occur.

air_store_id - the restaurant's id in the air system
visit_datetime - the time of the reservation
reserve_datetime - the time the reservation was made
reserve_visitors - the number of visitors for that reservation
hpg_reserve.csv
This file contains reservations made in the hpg system.

hpg_store_id - the restaurant's id in the hpg system
visit_datetime - the time of the reservation
reserve_datetime - the time the reservation was made
reserve_visitors - the number of visitors for that reservation
air_store_info.csv
This file contains information about select air restaurants. Column names and contents are self-explanatory.

air_store_id
air_genre_name
air_area_name
latitude
longitude
Note: latitude and longitude are the latitude and longitude of the area to which the store belongs

hpg_store_info.csv
This file contains information about select hpg restaurants. Column names and contents are self-explanatory.

hpg_store_id
hpg_genre_name
hpg_area_name
latitude
longitude
Note: latitude and longitude are the latitude and longitude of the area to which the store belongs

store_id_relation.csv
This file allows you to join select restaurants that have both the air and hpg system.

hpg_store_id
air_store_id
air_visit_data.csv
This file contains historical visit data for the air restaurants.

air_store_id
visit_date - the date
visitors - the number of visitors to the restaurant on the date
sample_submission.csv
This file shows a submission in the correct format, including the days for which you must forecast.

id - the id is formed by concatenating the air_store_id and visit_date with an underscore
visitors- the number of visitors forecasted for the store and date combination
date_info.csv
This file gives basic information about the calendar dates in the dataset.

calendar_date
day_of_week
holiday_flg - is the day a holiday in Japan
